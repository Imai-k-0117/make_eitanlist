This summer I visited Canada and stayed with a family in a small town for three

weeks. My host sister was Sara. She was sixteen. We spent a lot of time together

outdoors and I felt very close to nature. It was a wonderful feeling.

My host family went camping every Saturday. We enjoyed riding in a boat on the

lake and walking in the forest. By a big tree, Sara told me to close my eyes. Then, she

said, "Put your hands on the tree and then put your ear to it." I listened hard and heard a

very small sound. I knew it had life, just like me.

One night, my host family went out by car. After about an hour, we stopped in a big

field and got out of the car. Sara said to me, "Have you ever been away from the city

lights?" Then, my host father turned off the car lights. It was all black. No one said

anything. The only sound I heard was the grass in the wind. I had a strange feeling. I

felt I was very small, like a piece of the grass in the field. After we got into the car, Sara

said to me, "How did you feel?" I said, "It was very strange. I felt I was very small, like

a piece of the grass." "That's interesting. I felt like the wind," said Sara.

On the last night, Sara and I slept in the backyard. The sky was full of stars. She

said to me, "The stars are so beautiful. When I'm looking at the stars, I feel so happy." I

said, "Yes, the stars give us peace of mind. I've really enjoyed the beautiful outdoors

since I came to Canada, so I've become close to nature. Thank you very much, Sara."

"My pleasure. Thank you, Naoko," she said.

Now in Japan, I still feel very close to nature. I like the smell of the grass

in the park. I like to look at the different kinds of green in the trees. Also, I enjoy

the sounds of the river on my way to school. Nature is with me all the time and
