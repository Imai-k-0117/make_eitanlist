It is sometimes difficult to go to sleep when we have a problem. But I found a good

way to get out of the problem. Today I'd like to share it with you.

Last year our class sang two songs in the school festival. My best friend, Mayumi,

played the piano for us. A week before the festival we had a problem. One of the songs

was too difficult, and Mayumi always stopped at the same part. She said, "I can't do this.

Can anyone else play the piano?" But Mayumi was the best player. "No one else can do

it. You should work harder," I said. "I'm practicing hard!" cried Mayumi and began to

play the piano again. No one enjoyed the practice after that.

On that night I couldn't sleep. I thought about Mayumi in bed. I said a bad thing

when I should be kind to her. I didn't know what I should do.

I went to drink some water. Then my mother came up to me and said, "You can't go

to sleep?" I told her about the mistake I made on that day. I wanted to go back to that

moment and shut my mouth.

My mother said to me, "The words you have said will never come back to your

mouth. What can you do now to change the future?"

I went back to bed and thought, "What can I do tomorrow? First I will say 'I'm

sorry,' to Mayumi. Next we should talk about the way to sing that song. Everyone

practiced it very hard, so we want to sing it. But the best pianist in the class can't play

it." Then I had a good idea. If two players play the song together, it may be easier. This

idea made me happy, and I went to sleep.

My idea worked well, and the chorus moved everyone in the hall. From this

experience I learned an important thing about life. When I cannot sleep because of a

problem, I always tell myself to think only about the future. If you know how to make a

change the next morning, you will feel better. I believe this will help you too when you

have a problem.
