Hello, everyone! How was your work experience? Many of us may think that it was

very hard, but I think it was a chance to think about our future.

Mr. Yamada, our classroom teacher, told me that I was going to work at a flower

shop. I was happy because I like flowers. And at the same time I worried a little. I said,

"Can I do a good job at the shop?" Mr. Yamada said, "No one can do things well from the

beginning. Do your best. A good attitude is important."

The next week my work experience started. I tried hard to learn names of flowers.

Mr. Kimura, the shopkeeper, taught me how to keep flowers beautiful and how to cut and

wrap them. I took care of flowers as he told me, and watched how Mr. Kimura did his

job. In the afternoon, when he was taking care of some customers, a woman came into

the shop and talked to me. It was my first time to help a customer! She said, "I would

like some roses," and asked me to choose some red ones. I took some and broke one by

mistake. I got embarrassed. When I tried to wrap them, I couldn't do it well. I thought,

"Mr. Kimura, help me!" Then she smiled at me and said, "You don't have to do it quickly.

Take your time. I'll wait." When I finished it, Mr. Kimura came and helped me to take

the money from her. When she was leaving, I tried to say, "Thank you very much"

cheerfully because I knew her smile and kind words helped me. After she left, Mr.

Kimura said, "Good job, Kenji! You were a little embarrassed but she looked very happy

with your good attitude and your Thank you." His words encouraged me to work very

hard until my last day.

Sometimes my work experience was hard. But I found out a lot of things about

flowers and learned what Mr. Kimura does in his shop. And also I have found out how

happy I am when customers are happy. I cannot tell what job I want to have in the

future, but I hope I will have good encounters with others in my job. Thank you.
