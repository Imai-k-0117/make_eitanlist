Hello, everyone. Today I'm going to talk about our school trip to Kyoto. On the first

day we visited some places in a group. We went to Kiyomizu-dera and some souvenir

shops. After that we had lunch. When I tried to pay, I found I didn't have my purse. I

looked into my bag and then looked around the restaurant, but I couldn't find it. I didn't

know what to do.

"Let's go back," a friend said. Everyone looked for my purse. While I was looking

for it, I remembered my mother's words. "You'll have a lot of money, so you should keep

your money in two purses. It will be safer." Then she gave me another purse. I always

thought she treated me like a child. "I don't need it," I said. I took only one purse on the

trip.

We looked for my purse for a long time, but we couldn't find it. So we called our

teacher. He said, "Come back to the hotel." At the hotel restaurant I didn't want to eat

dinner. Our teacher saw my sad face and said to me, "Are you OK? Don't worry too

much about it."

Just then, a man came in and said to our teacher, "A student's purse was brought to

the front desk." So I went there. "That's my purse!" I shouted. A clerk from one of the

souvenir shops brought it to the hotel. I said, "Thank you very much," but wondered how

he knew it was mine, so I asked him. When he was closing the shop, he found my purse

and a small piece of paper in it. My name and the name of our school were written on it.

He called the school and a teacher told him the name of our hotel. Do you know who put

the paper in my purse? - My mother did!

I'll never forget people's kindness during this trip. My friends in the group tried to

find my purse, so they couldn't go to Ginkaku-ji during the afternoon. The shop clerk was

tired after work, but came to the hotel late in the evening. And now I know that my

mother sometimes takes care of me so much because she loves me. Thank you.
